## Editing Convention
Whenever you wish to add a new feature:
1. Create a branch.
   - Naming: \<YY-MM-DD\>\_\<SUBTEAM\>\_\<FEATURE NAME\>
2. Edit the LOG in README.md specific to your branch!
   - Explain what this branch is meant to implement
4. Edit everything on the branch.
5. Test on the branch.
6. When you are sure the feature is correct, merge the branches.
   - The later-merged log should appear BELOW every previously merged branch.
